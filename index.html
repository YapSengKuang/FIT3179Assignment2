  <h2>Where are our Facebook Users?</h2>
  
  <div class="container">
    <div id="map"></div>
    <div class="map-text-container">
      <p class="map-text-left">
        The visual above is a choropleth map representing the <span class="blue">number of Facebook Users for every 10 000 individuals.</span> 
        The scale goes beyond 10 000 due to the dataset accounting for multiple accounts created by the same user. 
        The number of people using Facebook in different countries can be explained by a few simple reasons. 
        Some countries have more people using Facebook because they have better access to the internet and technology.
        In these places, more folks have smartphones 
        </p>
      <p class="map-text-right">
        and can easily use Facebook.
        Additionally, in some places, people are just more used to using social media for connecting with others.
         Sometimes, <span class="blue">government rules</span> about the internet can also affect how many people use Facebook. Finally, how Facebook
          is advertised and available in different languages can also make a difference. So, a combination of these things 
          determines how many people use Facebook in each country.</p>

  <h2>Which countries have the top amount of Facebook Users?</h2>
  <div class="container">
   
      
      <div class="map-text-container">
        <div id="barchart1"></div>
        <p class="map-text-right">
          The visual on the left shows the countries that have the top amount of Facebook users, per 10 000 individuals. 
          What is quite interesting is that Australia, and the United States of America is <span class="blue">not part of the top 10 </span>, despite being a developed country. This could be due to the perception
          of Facebook in these countries, being intrusive and being for the older generation.
        </p>

  <h2>Internet Access Accross the years</h2>
  <div class="container">
    <div id="interactive"></div>

    <div class="interactive-text-container">
        <p class="interactive-text-left">
          The visual above is an interactive choropleth map showing the <span class="blue">percentage of internet users</span> in each country. As expected, the typical developing countries, such as
          Australia, the majority of Europe and the United States of America, have a relatively high percentage of internet users compared to the rest of the world, for all years.

        </p>
        <p class="interactive-text-right">
          The visual, when in the year 2018 has some resemblance to the map showing the number of Facebook users per capita Worldwide. This could be a correlation between having
          access to internet and the number of Facebook users.
